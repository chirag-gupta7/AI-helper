# Voice Assistant Updates Summary

## 🎯 Changes Made

### ✅ **UTF-8 Encoding Fix**
- Added proper UTF-8 encoding configuration for stdout/stderr
- Prevents encoding errors when processing text with special characters
- Uses `sys.stdout.reconfigure(encoding='utf-8')` for Python 3.7+

### ✅ **Improved ElevenLabs Imports**
- Enhanced import handling with better error catching
- Added individual try/catch blocks for different ElevenLabs components
- More graceful degradation when specific features aren't available

### ✅ **Enhanced Agent Initialization**
- Updated `initialize_elevenlabs_agent()` with better API testing
- Uses `Models.from_api()` to verify connection before proceeding
- More informative logging with emojis for better readability

### ✅ **Robust Speech Generation**
- Replaced complex `generate_speech()` with simpler, more reliable version
- Added character filtering to prevent encoding issues: `ord(c) < 65536`
- Improved fallback chain: ElevenLabs → pyttsx3 → text-only

### ✅ **Better Audio Playback**
- Added `_play_audio_file()` function with multiple playback methods
- Uses pygame as primary method, falls back to ElevenLabs play function
- Automatic cleanup of temporary audio files

### ✅ **Enhanced Error Handling**
- Better error messages with visual indicators (✅, ❌, ⚠️)
- More specific exception handling for different failure modes
- Graceful degradation when dependencies are missing

### ✅ **Improved pyttsx3 Fallback**
- Better voice selection logic
- ASCII character conversion for compatibility
- Optimized speech rate and volume settings

## 🚀 **Key Improvements from Uploaded File**

1. **Character Safety**: Filters problematic Unicode characters
2. **File-based Audio**: Saves audio to temp file for better playback control
3. **Multiple Playback Methods**: pygame → ElevenLabs play → fallback
4. **Better Logging**: More informative status messages
5. **Safer Imports**: Individual component import testing

## 🔧 **Technical Details**

### New Functions Added:
- `_fallback_pyttsx3(text_to_speak)` - Dedicated pyttsx3 handler
- `_play_audio_file(file_path)` - Multi-method audio playback
- `_play_text_via_modern_api(text_to_speak, voice)` - Simplified API

### Updated Functions:
- `initialize_elevenlabs_agent()` - Better connection testing
- `generate_speech()` - Simplified and more reliable
- Enhanced error handling throughout

## 📋 **Dependencies**

### Required:
- `elevenlabs` - Primary TTS service
- `pyttsx3` - Fallback TTS

### Optional:
- `pygame` - Audio playback (gracefully handled if missing)

## 🎯 **Usage**

The updated voice assistant now:
1. **Handles encoding issues** automatically
2. **Falls back gracefully** when services are unavailable  
3. **Provides better feedback** through improved logging
4. **Works more reliably** across different environments

All existing APIs remain compatible, so no changes needed in calling code!
